# profit-expenses
First attempt at python script to enter and track business profits/expenses

Very WIP, first personal project. Would like to start with this and eventually
integrate the ability to have it directly update an excel/google sheet



personal note so I don't confuse myself with format, data set would look like:
"orders[[name,price,address,order_date,ship_date,tracking_number], [name,price,address,order_date,ship_date,tracking_number], [etc]]"

orders_data... 
0 = name
1 = price
2 = address
3 = order date
4 = ship date
5 = tracking number
