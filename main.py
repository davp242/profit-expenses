# Goals for Sunday: make menu function with options to enter new profit or new expense. Probably will try
# using nested lists? ie profit[[name, address, flt(dollar amount)][name, address, flt(dollar amount)]] etc.
# to track them. Create functions for profit and expense entries and focus on getting them to correctly
# update the data sets, focus on getting the values to save to something simple like a .txt file eventually
# and worry about moving it to a spreadsheet later on. Still afraid to work with fancy APIs
